The shapes are geometric and stylised — curved planes, clean lines — creating symmetry and calm. The composition evokes mentorship, dialogue, and shared illumination, symbolising knowledge exchanged through trust and reciprocity.](https://github.com/Peter-Kahl/Evaluating-Higher-Education-through-the-University-of-Readings-LLM-Experience/blob/main/fiduciary_dialogue.jpg?raw=true)

## Abstract

This paper examines the University of Reading’s LLM programme as a living case of the epistemic, fiduciary, and pedagogical tensions defining higher education today. It is written not in grievance but in fulfilment of the university’s own invitation for feedback—an act of reflective candour rather than administrative compliance. By situating personal experience within the broader analytical framework of _Epistemic Clientelism Theory_ (Kahl 2025) and _Epistemocracy in Higher Education_ (Kahl 2025), the paper argues that universities increasingly reproduce epistemic dependency and performative visibility rather than authentic dialogue.

Drawing on evidence from institutional communication and culture—feedback mechanisms that pre-structure consent, ceremonial “How’s it going?” events, and the recurring visual branding of vice-chancellorial leadership—the study identifies how higher education’s fiduciary mandate to truth and plurality has been displaced by optocratic drift and substitutive visibility. Even seemingly progressive gestures, such as the University’s use of the “global-warming stripes” visual, illustrate how inherited virtue substitutes for living epistemic plurality.

The paper concludes with a proposal for a pedagogy of fiduciary dialogue: an ethical-epistemic framework that re-anchors education in reciprocity, candour, and care. Instead of managerial feedback loops, universities must cultivate fiduciary relationships of mutual accountability—where speaking truth is an act of service to knowledge itself.
